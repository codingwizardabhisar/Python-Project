# Double Pendulum and Circular Paraboloid using meshgrid Plot

This repository contains Python code for simulating a double pendulum and plotting a circular paraboloid using Matplotlib.

## Double Pendulum

### Overview

The `double_pendulum.py` script simulates the motion of a double pendulum using the equations of motion. It includes a 3D animation of the double pendulum's motion.

### Instructions

To run the double pendulum simulation, you can use the following steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed, including NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, and the Matplotlib Animation module.

3. Run the `double_pendulum.py` script.

##Circular Paraboloid

### Overview

The `CircularParaboloid.py` script generates a 2D and 3D plot of a circular paraboloid using Matplotlib and NumPy.


### Instructions

To run the circular paraboloid plot, you can use the following steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed, including NumPy and Matplotlib.

3. Run the `CircularParaboloid.py` script.
